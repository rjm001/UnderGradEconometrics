\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{5.7}
	Question Statement
	
	$Q_{1^s}$
	= $\bar{p}_{1^s}$
	$\Updelta CS_2$
	$2^s$
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[a] For each sample partition, obtain the summary statistics of $WAGE$

	

	\item[b] A variable's \textit{coefficient of variation} is 100 times the ratio of its sample standard deviation to its sample mean. That is, for a variable y it is $$CV(y):= 100 \times \frac{s_y}{\bar{y}}$$ where $s_y$ is $y$'s standard deviation and $\bar{y}$ is $y$'s average. What is the coefficient of variation for $WAGE$ within each sample partition?
	
	\item[c] For each sample partition, estimate hte log-linear model $$\log(WAGE) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 EDUC + e$$ What is the approximate percentage return to another year of education for each group?
	
	\item[d] Does the model fit the data equally well for each sample partition?
	
	\item[e] For each sample partition, test the null hypothesis that the rate of return to education is 10\% against the alternative that it is not, using a two-tail test at the 5\% level of significance.
\end{itemize}
